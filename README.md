# Jwt-token-refresh-and-expiry--1
A JWT (JSON Web Token) is used to securely transmit user data between a client and a server. It contains an expiry time (exp) that defines how long it remains valid. Once expired, the token cannot be used. To avoid forcing users to log in again, a refresh token is issued, which lasts longer and can be used to get a new access token.
